# Pentesting Fundamentals

**Penetration Test**: is an authorised audit of a computer system's security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems

Rules of Engagement (**ROE**) - A document that gives permission to a penetration tester, defining the targets that the engagement applies to and the behaviours/techniques that are used
- [SANS Example](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/?)

| Section   | Description   |
|---|---|
|Permission   |This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.   |
|Test Scope   | This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.  |
|Rules   | The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay   |

**Methodology**: Steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement Most methodologies follow a similar structure to the steps below

| Stage  | Description  |
|---|---|
| Information Gathering   | This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research. (*not scanning systems*)  |
| Enumeration/Scanning  | This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.  |
| Exploitation  | This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic  |
| Privilege Escalation   | Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a **foothold**), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate: <br> - **horizontally** where accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user) <br> - **vertically** accessing that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).  |
| Post-exploitation  | This stage involves a few sub-stages: <br> 1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting) <br> 2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user <br> 3.  Covering your tracks <br> 4. Reporting  |

## OSSTMM
The [Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity. The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:
- Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
- Wired Networks
- Wireless communications

## OWASP
The [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/) framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.The foundation regularly writes reports stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.
- The framework doesn't hold any accreditation such as **CHECK**

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.  There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.
- The framework does not consider cloud computing,

## NCSC CAF
The [Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cyber-assessment-framework/caf-objective-a-managing-security-risk) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:
- Data security
- System security
- Identity and access control
- Resiliency
- Monitoring
- Response and recovery planning

There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service. Your understanding of your target will determine the level of testing that you perform in your penetration testing engagement

## Black-Box Testing
This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.
- Tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software

## Grey-Box Testing
The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. 
- Will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.

## White-Box Testing
The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time.
- The tester will have full knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour

**Exploitation**: The use of a vulnerability discovered to gain un-authorised access to an information security system or data.
