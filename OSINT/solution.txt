	- Linux Compile - `gcc 33d07246373a77e2c05346ebbe17f110.c -static -lm -o 33d07246373a77e2c05346ebbe17f110`
	- Windows Compile - `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe -static -lm 33d07246373a77e2c05346ebbe17f110.c -o 33d07246373a77e2c05346ebbe17f110.exe`

---- SOLUTION ----
» Intended Setup
	1. Analyse Dossier to find
		» Recognise Logo
		» Recognise Accomplice Photo
		» Recognise File hash matches executable
	2. Run Executable to find:
		» Recognise Cr0w3 Name
		» Recognise Github hint
		» Recognise version number
	3. Search CROW3 on Github and see matching Profile Pic
	4. Find the matching CYB3R_CR0W3_G3N3RAT0R.c which has same version and md5 hash for name (but removed flag variable)
		» CROW3INC Distributable Folders
		» Other codes and files can be a distraction
	5. Inside commit history of CYB3R_CR0W3_G3N3RAT0R.c find a removed print statement saying "Follow us at @Cr0w3Inc" 
		» Another commit with flag variable saying "Nice Try"
	6. Find Youtube Video that way, recognise hint its from General Aragorn 
		» Aragorn full of code that is a dead end and false flags
	7. Luxus account dumped with fake codes and flags

» Unconventional Solutions
	1. BruteForce
	   » Iterate the exe for 10 million iterations
	2. Reverse Engineer
	   » Use cutter / ghidra / ida to trace operation
	   » Find contents of sec variable which is key and length with keyLen
	   » Acquire hexadecimal of encrypted flag and apply XOR with (flag,sec,26,keyLen) to decrypt
